#### The Project Goal and Data
Safve Heart is a Clinical Support System (CSS) designed to help clinicians predict heart disease (1). 
This project was be developed by Health Informatics students for Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University 
over the course of 8 weeks 
based on datasets from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, de V.A. Medical Center and the University of Zurich (2)
###data
Our first task related to become familiar with the data 
Processed both Cleveland exclusively, and all four datasets combined
###Pre-processing
Used one-hot encoding for the categorical data. Variables are converted into a form that could be provided to ML algorithms to do a better job in prediction. 
For remaining continuous data, data was normalised, scaler, removing the mean and scaling the data to unit variance. 
###Tools 
Python + libraries
Dash for interactive tool 
###Environments:
Jupyter Notebook and spyder
