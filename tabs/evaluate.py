#### Classification Evaluation 
A variety of well-known classifiers were discussed, after the individual work of several students, we have concluded to use the following three classifiers. 
Random forest classifier + Random Search Cross-validation has the following results of evaluation
SVM + Random Search CV
Logistic regression
The required  evaluation metrics: precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy, AUC + Confusion matrix. 
Final decision: Cleveland Data with logistic regression 
#### other suggestions
Processed data in two different ways 
Model 1: Cleveland data, one-hot encoding 
Model 2: All four datasets, normalisation 
Chose different classifiers 
Support vector machine 
Random Forest 
Logistic regression 
Employed different models 
The two models above, classified from 0-4 
Model 3: Cleveland data, classified 0 and 1
